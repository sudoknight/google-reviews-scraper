## Reviews are opened in two ways
When we google any place and click on the "view reviews" link/button, Reviews can be opened in two modes.
1. They are opened in a new screen. Its like a full screen mode you can easily scroll the reviews. 

2. They are open in a dialog box. And you have to scroll inside that dialog box to scrape the reviews.

There are differences in review text formating in these two modes. For example, In (1) we can see (Original) text and (Translated by Google) text, as part of the displayed review text. Where as in (1) we have to click the "show original" button to see the original review text.


## Config
The structure of the yml files should be the following

```yml
output_dir: "<my_output_directory_path>"

```
- output_dir: The directory where the output file/folders will be created
- stop_criteria: reviewer/contributer to find. Rather than scraping all the reviews until the end, terminate the scraping process when this username/review is encountered.
